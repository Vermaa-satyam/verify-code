### Project Description: Email OTP Verification System

This project involves the development of an email OTP (One-Time Password) verification system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Although the backend is still under development, the frontend is designed to handle OTP verification with a fixed OTP value for testing purposes.

**Features:**
- **Email OTP Verification**: Users are required to enter an OTP sent to their email address for verification.
- **Static OTP for Testing**: During development, the OTP is fixed at `2005`, allowing for straightforward front-end testing without backend integration.
- **User Interface**: The page features a clean and modern design with responsive input fields and user-friendly error and success messages.

**Technology Stack:**
- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the OTP verification form, including input fields and buttons.
- **CSS**: Styles the page with a contemporary look, enhancing the user experience with well-defined input fields, buttons, and messages.
- **JavaScript**: Manages the OTP verification logic and user interactions, including input handling and dynamic feedback based on user input.

**Current Status:**
- The frontend is fully implemented and operational.
- The backend integration is pending, which will later handle dynamic OTP generation and validation.

**Next Steps:**
- **Backend Development**: Implement the server-side logic to generate and validate OTPs.
- **Testing**: Conduct end-to-end testing to ensure functionality and user experience across different scenarios.
